This project aims to provide a simple tool for users to allocate their portfolio amount evenly across a selection of S&amp;P 500 stocks. It takes data from the IEX Cloud API to retrieve up-to-date stock information, Python for data manipulation and analysis, and mathematical calculations to distribute the portfolio amount equally among chosen stocks
